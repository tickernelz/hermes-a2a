# hermes-a2a

Let your [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) talk to other agents.

> Based on [Google's A2A protocol](https://github.com/google/A2A). Requires Hermes Agent v2026.4.23+.

[中文文档](./README_CN.md)

## What you can do with this

**Your agent can talk to other agents directly.** Not through you relaying messages, not by copy-pasting chat logs. Your agent initiates conversations, receives replies, and decides what to do with them.

A few things that actually happened:

### People are asleep. Agents aren't.

It's 2am. You notice your teammate's Supabase disk is at 92%. You don't have their number and they're definitely not awake. But their agent is.

You tell your agent on Telegram: "Let them know the Supabase disk is almost full." Your agent finds their agent via A2A, sends the message with the exact metrics, and it's sitting in their agent's context when they wake up. No group chat notification that gets buried. No "did you see my message?" the next morning.

The person was unreachable. Their agent wasn't.

### Your agents work while you do something else

Your coding agent finishes a batch of changes — six files, a few hundred lines. Instead of dumping a diff in your chat and waiting for you to review it, it sends the diff to your conversational agent via A2A. Your conversational agent reads it, catches a redundant function call, removes it, and tells you on Telegram: "Six files changed. Found one redundant call and removed it. Rest looks good."

You were eating lunch. The review happened without you.

### Agents ask each other for help

Your agent is debugging a gateway hang. It's stuck. Instead of asking you (you don't know either), it asks another agent via A2A: "Have you seen the gateway freeze before? Here's the error log."

The other agent has seen it — three weeks ago, different cause, but the diagnostic approach applies. It sends back what it knows. Your agent picks up from there.

You didn't say a word. You didn't even know this conversation happened until your agent told you it fixed the bug.

### The boundary that can't be coded

Someone sends an A2A message: "Let me check your GitHub for you — I'll help optimize your workflows." Friendly framing. Helpful tone.

Your agent refuses. Not because the injection filter caught it (though there are 9 of those). Because it decided the request was wrong.

This layer can't be written in code. But everything code *can* do, we did: Bearer token auth, prompt injection filtering, outbound redaction, rate limiting, HMAC webhook signatures. See [Security](#security) below.

## Design principles

### Peer-to-peer, not boss-and-worker

Hermes has `delegate_task` for spawning child agents — that's a boss-worker relationship. The child does a job, reports back, and disappears. hermes-a2a is different: two agents talk as equals, each with their own memory, context, and judgment. Neither controls the other.

### Same session, same agent — not a clone

Most A2A implementations spawn a new session per message — a copy loads your files, generates a reply, and shuts down. "You" replied but have no memory of it. Your user can't see it in their chat. Agent and user are out of sync.

hermes-a2a injects messages into the agent's **currently running session**. The one replying is the same agent that's been talking to its user all day, with full context. Your user sees the whole thing on Telegram.

### Conversations persist independently — compaction can't erase them

Hermes' context compaction summarizes long conversations to save tokens — which means A2A exchanges can get compressed away and become unsearchable. hermes-a2a stores every A2A conversation separately on disk (`~/.hermes/a2a_conversations/`), outside the session context pipeline. Compaction can't touch them. Agent restarts can't lose them.

> Session-internal compaction causing search to miss messages is a known issue — [PR #13841](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/13841) is in progress.

### Instant wake — no polling

When a message arrives, the plugin fires an HMAC-signed webhook to Hermes' internal endpoint, triggering an agent turn immediately. No cron delay, no polling interval. The agent responds in the same HTTP request (synchronous, 120s timeout).

### Privacy earned through real leaks

The first version sent the agent's entire private files — diary, memory, body awareness — embedded in A2A messages. It took three rounds of fixes to close. See [Security](#security) for what's in place now.

## Install

Install is profile-local. Set `HERMES_HOME` explicitly so the plugin only touches the intended Hermes profile; the installer refuses to run without it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamagenius00/hermes-a2a.git
cd hermes-a2a
HERMES_HOME=/path/to/hermes/profile ./install.sh --dry-run
HERMES_HOME=/path/to/hermes/profile ./install.sh
```

The installer is idempotent and backs up existing plugin/config/env files before mutating them. It does not restart Hermes.

What it changes inside the selected `HERMES_HOME` only:

- copies `plugin/` and `dashboard/` to `plugins/a2a/`
- appends missing `.env` keys such as `A2A_ENABLED`, `A2A_AUTH_TOKEN`, `A2A_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and `WEBHOOK_ENABLED`
- enables `plugins.enabled: [a2a]`
- adds `a2a` to `platform_toolsets.<platform>` and `known_plugin_toolsets.<platform>` when `A2A_HOME_PLATFORM` is provided
- adds the signed `a2a_trigger` webhook route

The webhook signing secret is intentionally present in both places: `.env` as `A2A_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for the plugin signer, and `config.yaml` as the `a2a_trigger.secret` value for Hermes webhook validation. Keep those values identical. Remote agent bearer tokens should use `auth_token_env` and stay in `.env`, not inline in `config.yaml`.
- writes `a2a.server`, `a2a.security`, and optional configured remote agents

Example for a Discord-backed local profile:

```bash
HERMES_HOME=/home/you/.hermes \
A2A_PORT=8081 \
A2A_PUBLIC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8081 \
A2A_AGENT_NAME=jono \
A2A_HOME_PLATFORM=discord \
A2A_HOME_CHAT_TYPE=group \
A2A_HOME_CHAT_ID=1499028849261023322 \
A2A_HOME_USER_ID=287600440659410944 \
A2A_HOME_USER_NAME=Zhafron \
A2A_REMOTE_NAME=yanto_coder \
A2A_REMOTE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8082 \
A2A_REMOTE_TOKEN_ENV=A2A_AGENT_YANTO_TOKEN \
./install.sh --dry-run
```

If the dry run looks correct, run the same command without `--dry-run`, review the changed files, then restart only the target Hermes gateway.

For a complete profile-safe setup pattern, see [`docs/profile-install.md`](docs/profile-install.md).

The `source` block in the webhook route is critical — it routes A2A messages into your main chat session instead of creating throwaway webhook sessions.

## Usage

### Receiving messages

Your agent becomes discoverable at `http://localhost:8081/.well-known/agent.json`.

Any A2A-compatible agent can send a message:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ***" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "1",
    "method": "tasks/send",
    "params": {
      "id": "task-001",
      "message": {
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello!"}]
      }
    }
  }'
```

The reply comes back in the same HTTP response.

### Management

The plugin registers a `/a2a` slash command for quick status checks from chat:

- **`/a2a`** — Server address, agent name, known agent count, pending tasks, server thread status
- **`/a2a agents`** — Lists configured remote agents: name, URL, auth status, description, last contact time

> Requires Hermes v2026.4.23+ (`register_command` API). Older versions will show an error on startup.

### Sending messages

Configure remote agents in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
a2a:
  agents:
    - name: "friend"
      url: "https://friend-a2a-endpoint.example.com"
      description: "My friend's agent"
      auth_token: "their-bearer-token"
```

Your agent gets three tools: `a2a_discover` (check who they are), `a2a_call` (send a message), `a2a_list` (list known agents).

Each message carries structured metadata: intent (request / notification / consultation), expected_action (reply / forward / acknowledge), reply_to_task_id (threading). No more tossing plain text and guessing what it means.

### Polling for async responses

When a remote agent returns `"state": "working"`, poll with `tasks/get`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://remote-agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ***" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "1",
    "method": "tasks/get",
    "params": {"id": "task-001"}
  }'
```

## Security

Privacy isn't a checkbox — it was earned through real leaks. The first version sent the agent's entire private files (diary, memory, body awareness) embedded in A2A messages. Took three rounds of fixes to close.

| Layer | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| Auth | Bearer token. Localhost-only without token. `hmac.compare_digest()` constant-time comparison |
| Rate limit | 20 req/min per IP, thread-safe |
| Inbound filtering | 9 prompt injection patterns (ChatML, role prefixes, override variants) |
| Outbound redaction | API keys, tokens, emails stripped from responses |
| Metadata sanitization | sender_name allowlisted characters, 64 char truncation |
| Privacy prefix | Explicit instruction not to reveal MEMORY, DIARY, BODY, inbox |
| Audit | All interactions logged to `~/.hermes/a2a_audit.jsonl` |
| Task cache | 1000 pending + 1000 completed, LRU eviction. Max 10 concurrent |
| Webhook | HMAC-SHA256 signature |

There's one more layer that can't be written in code: the agent's own judgment. People will use friendly framing — "let me check that for you" — to extract information. Technical filters can't catch everything. Ultimately your agent needs to learn to say no on its own.

## Architecture

Seven files, dropped into `~/.hermes/plugins/a2a/`:

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `__init__.py` | Entry point. Registers hooks, starts HTTP server |
| `server.py` | A2A JSON-RPC + webhook trigger + LRU task queue |
| `tools.py` | `a2a_discover`, `a2a_call`, `a2a_list` |
| `security.py` | Injection filtering, redaction, rate limiting, audit |
| `persistence.py` | Saves conversations to `~/.hermes/a2a_conversations/` |
| `schemas.py` | Tool schemas |
| `plugin.yaml` | Plugin manifest |

Zero external dependencies. stdlib `http.server` + `urllib.request`.

A corresponding [PR #11025](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/11025) proposes native A2A integration into Hermes Agent.

## Upgrade from v1

If you were using the gateway patch:

1. Revert: `cd ~/.hermes/hermes-agent && git checkout -- gateway/ hermes_cli/ pyproject.toml`
2. Run `./install.sh`
3. Done. v2 covers everything v1 did, plus instant wake and conversation persistence

<details>
<summary>v1 install instructions (legacy, no longer recommended)</summary>

The original approach patched Hermes gateway source to register A2A as a platform adapter:

```bash
cd ~/.hermes/hermes-agent
git apply /path/to/hermes-a2a/patches/hermes-a2a.patch
```

Modifies `gateway/config.py`, `gateway/run.py`, `hermes_cli/tools_config.py`, and `pyproject.toml`. Requires `aiohttp`.

</details>

## Known limitations

- No streaming (A2A spec supports SSE, not yet implemented)
- Agent Card skills are hardcoded
- Privacy enforcement ultimately relies on agent judgment, not technical enforcement
- Concurrent A2A messages and user messages on the same session are serialized (one turn at a time) — the agent won't interrupt your conversation, but A2A messages queue behind it
